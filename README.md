This repository contains my journey of learning Python programming.

## Getting Started

1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Choose a text editor or IDE (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm, IDLE)
3. Create a new .py file for each exercise or project

## Basic Concepts

- Variables and data types
- Control flow (if/else statements, loops)
- Functions
- Lists, dictionaries, and other data structures
- Object-oriented programming

## Resources

- [Python for Beginners](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)
- [Codecademy Python Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)

## Projects

As I progress, I'll add simple projects here to practice my skills.

## Notes

I'll use this section to keep track of important concepts and tips I learn along the way.
